# hello-world
This is the beginning of my journey as a developer. I'm excited to create and collaborate. Thanks.

Interested in becoming a fullstack developer.
Through traditional college and self study I have gained
basic level experience with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and intermediate level experience with MySQL.

Currently, refreshing skills and preparing myself for a coding bootcamp in Albuquerque, NM.
